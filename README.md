# Smart Contract: Mortal Greeter

This repository contains a simple Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity. The contract consists of two parts: mortal and greeter.

## mortal Contract
The `mortal` contract provides basic functionality for contract destruction. It has the following features:

- __Constructor (`mortal()`)__: Initializes the contract by setting the owner variable to the address of the contract deployer.
- __Function (`kill()`)__: Allows the owner of the contract to self-destruct it, sending any remaining funds to the owner's address.

## greeter Contract
The `greeter` contract inherits from the `mortal` contract and introduces a basic greeting functionality. Key features include:

- __Constructor (`greeter(string _greeting)`)__: Initializes the contract with a specified greeting message.
- __Function (`greet()`)__: Returns the stored greeting message.

## Usage
To use these contracts, you need to deploy them on the Ethereum blockchain using a development environment or online platform like Remix. Follow these steps:

1. Deploy the `mortal` contract first.
2. Deploy the `greeter` contract, specifying the initial greeting message during deployment.
Once deployed, you can interact with the contracts using Ethereum transactions.

# Note
Be cautious when using the `kill()` function, as it permanently destroys the contract.
